# Names demo

This includes a very simple demo of classifying pet names using the scikit-learn
implementation of a Na√Øve Bayes classifier and data from NLTK's corpus
collection. The three command-line endpoints are

-   [`split.py`](split.py): splits the data into train, development, and test.
-   [`train.py`](train.py): trains the model
-   [`evaluate.py`](evaluate.py): evaluates the model's performance
